                        <p>You can visit most areas of the Website without providing any information about you. However, our Website may 
                        include certain applications that require specific personal data from you.
                        Before using any of the aforementioned applications we may require some personal data from you. Such personal data is 
                        needed to fulfil our legitimate interests of knowing you as a user of our Website or to offer you, as a potential 
                        customer, products or services that fulfil your needs. Such personal data may also be needed for the purpose of 
                        entering into, or providing services under, a contract with you. The provision of your personal data is voluntary and 
                        is therefore based on your consent. <br/> <br/> However, if you do not provide such personal data, you may not be able to receive the requested information from us.
                        eezyshipper also collects and processes personal data it did not collect from you.

At this time, our server will also query your computer to see if there are “cookies” previously set by the Website to facilitate log in, or other site navigation procedures.
                        Our Website may contain applications that allow you to book shipments, in which case you need to provide us with third party personal data necessary to arrange for such shipment. In such case, you represent and warrant to eezyshipper that you have obtained all necessary third party consents for the processing of such personal data contemplated by the shipment.
